Driven by a mix of curiosity and concern, you muster the courage to leave your bed and venture towards your sister's room.
The persistent cold air adds to the eerie ambiance that has permeated your house, and as you approach her room, the bangs grow louder,
accompanied by muffled voices. Opening the door reveals a scene of disarray, with furniture overturned and belongings scattered.
Filled with worry for your sister's safety, you call out to her, but there's no response. Compelled by a need for answers, you press on, 
moving closer to her bed. Suddenly, a gust of wind extinguishes a nearby candle, enveloping the room in darkness and intensifying the chilling
sensation, further fueling your determination to uncover the truth behind these inexplicable occurrences.
